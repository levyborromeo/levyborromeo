# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/levyborromeo/">Levy Borromeo</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio üîê

Welcome! I'm Levy Borromeo - a seasoned project manager transitioning into cybersecurity with a focus on vulnerability management, threat detection, and risk mitigation. My background in leading corporate initiatives, optimising workflows, and driving customer-centric innovation gives me a strategic edge in understanding security from both technical and business perspectives. 

I'm currently undergoing hands-on training in a simulated Security Operations Centre (SOC), where I work with enterprise-grade tools such as:
- **Tenable** for vulnerability scanning and remediation
- **Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)** for log analysis and threat detection
- **Defender for Endpoint (EDR)** for incident response
- **Azure VMs** for secure infrastructure deployment

**What you'll find in this portfolio:**
- Real-world cybersecurity labs and documentation
- Python scripts for automation and analysis
- Risk assessment and threat hunting exercises
- Projects that reflect my ability to translate business needs into secure, scalable solutions
